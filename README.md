# 📈 Apple Stock Price Prediction

This project predicts Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock prices using machine learning and deep learning models. The code processes historical stock data and implements models like LSTM, ARIMA, SARIMAX, XGBoost, and Random Forest.

## 🔍 Features

- Time series forecasting using:
  - LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
  - ARIMA and SARIMAX
  - XGBoost and Random Forest
- Data visualization and trend decomposition
- Model evaluation using MAE, RMSE, and R² Score
- Web application with Streamlit for real-time predictions
